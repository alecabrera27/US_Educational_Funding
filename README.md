# US_Educational_Funding
Analysis of how funding levels impact state outcomes for students.

## Selected Topic
An investigation into state revenue ratios and their potential relationship with standardized test scores. 

## Rationale
Understanding that funding across states vary, as well as how these dollars are spent, we are inspecting the ratios of funding revenue (federal, state and local) and expenditure for each state within our dataset.

## Datasets
We are utilizing a dataset from kaggle contained here: https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project

## Questions Sought
We are curious if the levels of funding revenue and state expenditure ratios have a relationship to or impact the outcomes for fourth and eight graders taking the NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Process). Understanding this will help inform stakeholders on how to best spend dollars to achieve positive net student outcomes.
