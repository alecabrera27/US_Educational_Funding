# Data Analytics & Visualization Boot Camp - Final Project - Group 5

## Selected topic

Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, we are investigating if there is a relationship between the revenue and expeditures of a state on education and their average NAEP Math/Reading exam scores.  

## Rationale for selecting the topic

We understand that each state represented within the dataset receives a different level of revenue with respect to their federal, state and local funding streams. Further, we also understand that each state has a different level of spending as it relates to instruction, support services, capital outlay and other items. Understanding then that because there are different levels of funding/expenditures, we are looking to explore if there exists trends that can be derived from the data with respect to the outcomes of the students within the state. By exploring this, we will be able to create a template to inform future practices as it relates to the funding and spending of states on their education as they develop their budgets. 

## Description of the source of data

We are utilizing the following [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project).

By performing an exploratory data analysis, we have found the following columns contained in the data that is pertinent to our exploration: 

* Demographic Information
 * Year
 * State
 * Enrolled
* Financial Information
  * Total Revenue
   * Federal Revenue
   * State Revenue
   * Local Revenue
 * Instruction Expenditure
 * Support Services Expenditure
 * Capital Outlay Expenditure
 * Other Expenditure
* Student Outcomes
 * Average National Assessment of Educational Progress Math Scores (4th & 8th Grade)
 * Average National Assessment of Educational Progress Reading Scores (4th & 8th Grade)

## Questions we are seeking to answer with the data

The team is specifically interested in looking at exploring the following:

* Are there correlations between funding and/or expenditures and the average state NAEP Math/Reading scores for 4th and 8th grade?
* How do funding and expenditures of higher performing states (as defined by higher average NAEP Math/Reading scores) compare to states that are lower performing?

By exploring the questions, we hope to provide advice/guidance to states as they advocate for funding or spend dollars on school budgets.
